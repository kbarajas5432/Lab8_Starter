## Paragraph:

Service workers play a key role in graceful degradation by ensuring that a web application can still function under reduced network conditions or even entirely offline. Graceful degradation is the idea that an application should still offer core functionality when newer technologies or ideal conditions like fast internet are not available. In this lab, we applied graceful degradation by caching essential resources such as recipe data, JavaScript, and CSS by using a service worker. This means that even if the user loses internet access, they can still view the recipes that were previously fetched. Service workers help bridge the gap between modern web app features and unpredictable real world environments, maintaining usability and performance even in suboptimal conditions.
